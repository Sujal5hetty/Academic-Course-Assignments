#5.2 Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'.
#Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
#If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and 
#put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.
